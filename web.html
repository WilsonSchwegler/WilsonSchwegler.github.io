                <hi>About the best website in the world</hi>
                <p>Welcome to the Coolmath network! These sites got started way back in 1997 to make math enjoyable for people who thought it couldn't be fun. We're happy to report that we've convinced millions of people over the years that cool + math is an equation that makes sense.

Here's a quick rundown of what our sites offer.

Coolmath.com

Our first site! Coolmath.com offers "math for ages 13-100" -- explanations that are easy to grasp on topics like algebra, pre-calculus and more. (I started my career as a math teacher, so it's a great pleasure for me to help people finally understand -- and even enjoy! -- doing math.)

Coolmath4Kids

For our 12 and under users, Coolmath4Kids is an amusement park of math, games, and more, designed to teach math and make it FUN.

Coolmath-Games

This is our brain-training site, for everyone, where logic & thinking meets fun & games. These games have no violence, no empty action, just a lot of challenges that will make you forget you're getting a mental workout!
